##The Big Short: Interest Rates Explained

Interest rates for loans are set using the probability of loan defaults to calculate a rate that minimizes the probability of losing money.
We can define the outcome of loans as a random variable. We can also define the sum of outcomes of many loans as a random variable.
The Central Limit Theorem can be applied to fit a normal distribution to the sum of profits over many loans. We can use properties of the normal distribution to calculate the interest rate needed to ensure a certain probability of losing money for a given probability of default.

Code: Interest rate sampling model
```{r}
n <- 1000
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000
p <- 0.02
defaults <- sample( c(0,1), n, prob=c(1-p, p), replace = TRUE)
sum(defaults * loss_per_foreclosure)
```

Code: Interest rate Monte Carlo simulation
```{r}
B <- 10000
losses <- replicate(B, {
    defaults <- sample( c(0,1), n, prob=c(1-p, p), replace = TRUE) 
  sum(defaults * loss_per_foreclosure)
})
```

Code: Plotting expected losses
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data.frame(losses_in_millions = losses/10^6) %>%
    ggplot(aes(losses_in_millions)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.6, col = "black)"
```

Code: Expected value and standard error of the sum of 1,000 loans
```{r}
n*(p*loss_per_foreclosure + (1-p)*0)    # expected value 
sqrt(n)*abs(loss_per_foreclosure)*sqrt(p*(1-p))    # standard error
```

Code: Calculating interest rates for expected value of 0
We can calculate the amount  to add to each loan so that the expected value is 0 using the equation *lp + x(1-p) = 0*. Note that this equation is the definition of expected value given a loss per foreclosure  with foreclosure probability  and profit  if there is no foreclosure (probability 1-p).

We solve for x = -(lp)/(1-p) and calculate :
```{r}
x = - loss_per_foreclosure*p/(1-p)
x
#On a $180,000 loan, this equals an interest rate of:
x/180000
```


Code: Calculating interest rate for 1% probability of losing money
```{r}
l <- loss_per_foreclosure
z <- qnorm(0.01)
x <- -l*( n*p - z*sqrt(n*p*(1-p)))/ ( n*(1-p) + z*sqrt(n*p*(1-p)))/x
x/180000    # interest rate
loss_per_foreclosure*p + x*(1-p)    # expected value of the profit per loan
n*(loss_per_foreclosure*p + x*(1-p)) # expected value of the profit over n loans
```

Code: Monte Carlo simulation for 1% probability of losing money
```{r}
B <- 100000
profit <- replicate(B, {
    draws <- sample( c(x, loss_per_foreclosure), n, 
                        prob=c(1-p, p), replace = TRUE) 
    sum(draws)
})
mean(profit)    # expected value of the profit over n loans
mean(profit<0)    # probability of losing money
```

##The Big Short

The Central Limit Theorem states that the sum of independent draws of a random variable follows a normal distribution. However, when the draws are not independent, this assumption does not hold.
If an event changes the probability of default for all borrowers, then the probability of the bank losing money changes.
Monte Carlo simulations can be used to model the effects of unknown changes in the probability of default.

```{r}
p <- .04
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000
r <- 0.05
x <- r*180000
loss_per_foreclosure*p + x*(1-p)
```

Code: Calculating number of loans for desired probability of losing money
The number of loans required is:
```{r}
z <- qnorm(0.01)
l <- loss_per_foreclosure
n <- ceiling((z^2*(x-l)^2*p*(1-p))/(l*p + x*(1-p))^2)
n    # number of loans required
n*(loss_per_foreclosure*p + x * (1-p))    # expected profit over n loans
```

Code: Monte Carlo simulation with known default probability
This Monte Carlo simulation estimates the expected profit given a known probability of default . Note that your results will differ from the video because the seed is not set.
```{r}
B <- 10000
p <- 0.04
x <- 0.05 * 180000
profit <- replicate(B, {
    draws <- sample( c(x, loss_per_foreclosure), n, 
                        prob=c(1-p, p), replace = TRUE) 
    sum(draws)
})
mean(profit)
```

Code: Monte Carlo simulation with unknown default probability
This Monte Carlo simulation estimates the expected profit given an unknown probability of default 0.03 <= p <= 0.05, modeling the situation where an event changes the probability of default for all borrowers simultaneously. Note that your results will differ from the video because the seed is not set.

```{r}
p <- 0.04
x <- 0.05*180000
profit <- replicate(B, {
    new_p <- 0.04 + sample(seq(-0.01, 0.01, length = 100), 1)
    draws <- sample( c(x, loss_per_foreclosure), n, 
                        prob=c(1-new_p, new_p), replace = TRUE)
    sum(draws)
})
mean(profit)    # expected profit
mean(profit < 0)    # probability of losing money
mean(profit < -10000000)    # probability of losing over $10 million
```
